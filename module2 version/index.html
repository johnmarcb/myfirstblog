            >n many occasions my girlfriend and I have had the discussion of getting a

            my first and last answer will always be a Golden Retriever.

            Those sad puppy dog eyes have an infinite capacity for love and will show you
            any chance it gets. As soon as they hear your keys from coming home, they're
            already there to say hello. If you're feeling sad, they'll sit at your feet.

            day.
