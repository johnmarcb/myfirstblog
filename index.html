    <h2>They're fully devoted</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
           Those sad puppy dog eyes have an infinite capacity for love and will show you any chance it gets. As soon as they hear your keys from coming home, they're already there to say hello. If you're feeling sad, they'll sit at your feet. They just simply get it right. Let's be honest, they will always make your day.</p>
